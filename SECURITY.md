## Reporting a Vulnerability
To help maintain the security and integrity of Just A Collection, we encourage users to report any vulnerabilities they encounter.

- <b>How to Report:</b><br>
Please report vulnerabilities via the Issues section on our GitHub repository.
Label the issue as "Security" and provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce, affected areas, and any other relevant information.

- <b>Response Timeline:</b><br>
Our team will review and respond to security-related issues within 5 business days.
You’ll receive updates on the status of your report as we progress with the investigation and, if applicable, the resolution.

- <b>Expected Outcomes:</b><br>
If a vulnerability is confirmed, we’ll work to resolve it promptly and will keep you updated on our progress.
For issues that we determine are not vulnerabilities, we will provide an explanation and, if possible, guidance on any necessary actions.


Once a reported vulnerability is addressed, the changes will be documented in the release notes, and you will see the fixes reflected in future
